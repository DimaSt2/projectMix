                                Bitcoin Mixer — is a set of tools or service that provides anonymity to the very first cryptocurrency - Bitcoin. Bitcoin Mixer terminates the connection between addresses inside the blockchain, while making it impossible to carry out any analysis or identification of the owner. There are many technologies that are referred to as Bitcoin Mixers. We have developed our own method of attaining anonymity of Bitcoin transactions by consulting with ex-staff of analytical companies, who have disclosed all their secrets to us.

                                No, Bitcoin is not anonymous and has never been. Bitcoin is a classical blockchain, which represents a public ledger. Think over these words – public ledger. Anyone can view it and track any funds transactions. Once your address is spotted on the internet or anywhere else, then criminal is able to completely track all funds transactions within your wallet, which will eventually lead him to the exchange, or any service that you paid for, or anywhere else where your identity was identified. It is quite easy to find the owner of Bitcoin address.

                                There may be various reasons for mixing, including provision of anonymity to your journalistic source, banal hiding of your financial activities from strangers, etc. Anonymity – is a right of every person and it is never superfluous.
